# Medium-GPT2

## Project

This is the repo for the Medium blog post I wrote, which you can find [here]()

`medium_scraper.py` contains the code to scrap Medium articles with data-science related tags.

`/data` is the folder that contains the scraped data

`GPT_2_Text_Generating_Model_w_GPU.ipynb` is a lightly edited version of [Max Woolfs GPT2-simple Google Colaboratory notebook](https://minimaxir.com/2019/09/howto-gpt2/)
